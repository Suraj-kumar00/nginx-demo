## Learning Path

### 🟢 Beginner Fundamentals

**Master the basics through hands-on examples**

* **NGINX Configuration Structure** – Understand server blocks, locations, directives
* **Static File Serving** – Serve HTML, CSS, JS with proper caching headers
* **Reverse Proxy Basics** – Forward requests to backend Node.js services
* **HTTP Headers & Response Handling** – Control caching, security headers

**Interactive Demos:**

* ✅ Test different configuration patterns
* ✅ Compare static vs dynamic content delivery
* ✅ Debug proxy connection issues

---

### 🟡 Intermediate Production-Ready

**Build production-grade features with real testing**

* **Load Balancing Strategies** – Round-robin, least connections, weighted distribution
* **SSL/TLS Configuration** – Self-signed certificates, HTTPS redirection, modern protocols
* **Basic Security** – Security headers, request filtering, basic rate limiting
* **Performance Optimization** – Gzip compression, connection pooling

**Interactive Demos:**

* ✅ Live load balancing visualization (3 backend servers)
* ✅ SSL certificate generation and testing
* ✅ Real-time request distribution monitoring
* ✅ Cache performance comparison

---

### 🔴 Advanced Enterprise-Level

**Enterprise patterns with monitoring and optimization**

* **Advanced Caching** – Proxy caching, cache invalidation, performance tuning
* **Security Hardening** – Rate limiting, DDoS protection, attack mitigation
* **Monitoring & Observability** – Custom logging, metrics collection, dashboards
* **High Availability** – Health checks, failover, graceful degradation

**Interactive Demos:**

* ✅ Real-time monitoring dashboard with live metrics
* ✅ Rate limiting stress testing
* ✅ Cache hit/miss ratio analysis
* ✅ Performance benchmarking tools
